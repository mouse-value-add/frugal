# frugal

**Open-source LLM proxy that routes every request to the cheapest model that won't compromise quality.**

[frugal.sh](https://frugal.sh) · [GitHub](https://github.com/frugalsh/frugal)

No account. No code changes. One command.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://frugal.sh/install | sh
```

```bash
frugal python my_app.py
```

That's it. Frugal starts a local proxy, injects `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, runs your command, and shuts down when it exits. Your app doesn't change. Your API keys stay local.

## How much does it actually save?

Run the benchmark on your own keys:

```bash
frugal bench --quality balanced --out bench.md
```

Frugal runs every problem in `config/workloads/starter.yaml` twice — once
through the router (cheapest model that clears your quality bar) and once
pinned to the baseline model. It scores each output against a deterministic
scorer (exact match, substring, JSON schema, or numeric tolerance) and prints
a report like:

```
# starter (quality=balanced, baseline=gpt-4o)

Problems: 20  ·  Frugal pass: 90.0%  ·  Baseline pass: 95.0%  ·  Δ: -5.0pp
Cost: frugal $0.0043  ·  baseline $0.0118  ·  savings 63.6%
```

No judge LLMs, no simulated numbers — these are the bytes your provider
billed you for. See [`config/workloads/starter.yaml`](./config/workloads/starter.yaml)
for the problem set and [`config/CAPABILITIES.md`](./config/CAPABILITIES.md)
for the methodology behind the capability scores the router uses.

## Use-case-first routing

Frugal's long-term shape is **use-case-first routing**: tell Frugal what you're
doing and it delivers the model + toolchain bundle that's proven best for that
kind of work. Set the `X-Frugal-Use-Case` header and the chat request routes to
the bundle's chat model for your quality tier.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Frugal-Use-Case: research-synthesis" \
  -H "X-Frugal-Quality: balanced" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"auto","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"..."}]}'
```

The starter catalog ships four use cases in [`config/use_cases/`](./config/use_cases/):

| Use case | What it matches | Balanced tier |
|---|---|---|
| `research-synthesis` | Long-form multi-source research | Claude Sonnet 4 |
| `code-dev` | Code generation, debugging, review | GPT-4.1 mini |
| `factual-qa` | Short factual lookups, trivia | GPT-4.1 nano |
| `structured-extraction` | Free text → JSON | Gemini 2.5 Flash |

Inspect bundles directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/bundles                           # every use case
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/bundles/research-synthesis        # default balanced tier
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/bundles/research-synthesis?quality=high
```

Bundles today are **curated** (`source: curated` in the YAML), with `as_of`
dates tracking when each was last refreshed. Upcoming releases add web search
and reranking as routed capabilities so bundles can declare the full toolchain,
not just the chat model. When `X-Frugal-Use-Case` is absent the classifier/router
path runs exactly as before — use-case routing is opt-in.

## How it works

Frugal wraps any command. It spins up a lightweight local proxy, sets `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to point at it, and routes every LLM request to the cheapest model that won't degrade quality.

```
frugal python app.py
       │
       ├─ starts proxy on a free port
       ├─ injects OPENAI_BASE_URL into your command's environment
       ├─ classifies each request (complexity, domain, capabilities)
       ├─ routes to cheapest model that clears the quality bar
       └─ shuts down proxy when your command exits
```

A creative brainstorm doesn't need `o3`. A simple extraction doesn't need `claude-opus`. You're paying for capability you don't use on 60-80% of your LLM calls.

### What the classifier detects

| Signal | How |
|--------|-----|
| Code | Regex for code blocks, `function`/`def`/`class` keywords |
| Math | LaTeX patterns, equation keywords |
| Reasoning depth | System prompt complexity, conversation length |
| Output format | JSON mode, tool/function calling |
| Domain | Keyword detection (coding, creative, analysis, math) |

These signals combine into a complexity score. The router picks the cheapest model that exceeds the quality threshold for that score.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://frugal.sh/install | sh
```

Downloads a single binary (~10MB), detects your API keys, adds `frugal` to your PATH.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frugalsh/frugal.git
cd frugal
make build
```

## Usage

### Wrap any command

```bash
frugal python my_app.py
frugal node server.js
frugal go run ./cmd/myservice
frugal pytest tests/
frugal bash -c 'curl https://api.openai.com/v1/...'
```

Frugal picks a free port, starts the proxy, sets `OPENAI_BASE_URL` in your command's environment, and cleans up on exit. Works with any OpenAI-compatible SDK — Python, Node, Go, Rust, curl.

### Run as a server

If you want a persistent proxy (e.g., shared across terminals or in Docker):

```bash
frugal serve
# or just: frugal (with no arguments)
```

Then set the env var yourself:

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
```

Optional hardening timeouts (Go duration syntax):

- `FRUGAL_READ_HEADER_TIMEOUT` (default `5s`)
- `FRUGAL_READ_TIMEOUT` (default `15s`)
- `FRUGAL_WRITE_TIMEOUT` (default `120s`)
- `FRUGAL_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (default `60s`)
- `FRUGAL_MAX_HEADER_BYTES` (default `1048576`)

### Auth, rate limits, logging (serve mode)

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `FRUGAL_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | Listen address. Non-loopback binds require `FRUGAL_AUTH_TOKEN` or `FRUGAL_ALLOW_UNAUTH=1`. |
| `FRUGAL_AUTH_TOKEN` | *(unset)* | Shared bearer token. When set, every `/v1/*` call must send `Authorization: Bearer $FRUGAL_AUTH_TOKEN`. |
| `FRUGAL_ALLOW_UNAUTH` | `0` | Escape hatch: setting to `1` allows unauthenticated binds on non-loopback. |
| `FRUGAL_RPS` | `30` | Global token-bucket rate in requests/sec. `0` disables. |
| `FRUGAL_BURST` | `60` | Token-bucket burst capacity. Clamped to `>= FRUGAL_RPS`. |
| `FRUGAL_MAX_COST_PER_REQUEST_USD` | `1.00` | Reject requests whose routing-time estimate exceeds this cap. Pinned requests bypass. `0` disables. |
| `FRUGAL_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error`. |
| `FRUGAL_LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | `text` for human-readable, `json` for structured ingestion. |
| `FRUGAL_DECISION_BUFFER` | `1000` | Capacity of the async routing-decision ring buffer. |

Prometheus metrics are served at `/metrics` behind the same auth as `/v1/*`.
All responses carry `X-Request-ID`; generate one client-side if you want to
correlate logs across your app and the proxy.

### Quality thresholds

Control cost vs. quality per request:

```python
headers = {"X-Frugal-Quality": "cost"}  # high | balanced | cost
```

| Threshold | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `high` | Top-tier models only. |
| `balanced` | Default. Best cost-quality tradeoff. |
| `cost` | Cheapest viable model. Maximum savings. |

### Model pinning

Skip routing for specific calls:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # goes straight to this model
    messages=[...]
)
```

### Fallback chains

```python
headers = {"X-Frugal-Fallback": "gpt-4o,claude-sonnet-4-20250514,gemini-2.5-flash"}
```

If the routed model errors, Frugal walks the chain.
To bound latency and cost, Frugal attempts at most the first 3 fallback models.
Frugal skips fallbacks that duplicate the routed model and ignores duplicate fallback entries.

## Supported models

Pricing synced from [models.dev](https://models.dev) on every startup.

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1-nano |
| Anthropic | Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Haiku 3.5 |
| Google | Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Flash |

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and/or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. Frugal registers whichever providers have keys.

Add models by editing `~/.frugal/config/models.yaml`.
